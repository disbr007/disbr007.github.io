I am a Masterâ€™s candidate studying the use of remote sensing for natural resource applications, from invasive
species management to landscape change - incorporating image segmentation, classification, and
machine learning. As a Graduate Research Assistant at the Polar Geospatial Center, I work both independently and
collaboratively to perform geospatial analyses, create static and dynamic map products, automate workflows, 
and develop custom GIS solutions.
